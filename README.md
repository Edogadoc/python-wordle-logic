# Python Wordle Logic Puzzle

## Project Overview
This is a logic-based command-line game developed as part of my Certificate III coursework. It demonstrates core programming concepts essential for scripting and automation in security contexts.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Input Validation:** Ensuring user input meets strict criteria (5-letter limit, valid characters) to prevent errors.
* **String Manipulation:** comparing strings index-by-index to determine exact matches vs. partial matches.
* **Control Flow:** Using `while` loops and conditional logic to manage game states (Win/Loss).
* **Python:** Written in pure Python 3.x with no external dependencies.

## How to Run
1.  Ensure you have all of the files installed in the same folder.
2.  Ensure you have Python (VSCode/IDLE) installed.
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python wordle.py
    ```

## Why this matters for Cyber Security?
Understanding how code processes string inputs and validates data is fundamental to understanding **Buffer Overflows** and **Input Sanitation** vulnerabilities. This project was an exercise in writing clean, logical code.
